For this project, I added three grey cubes to the right of the characters that will animate upon the player getting close to them.

The UI start screen buttons seemed to have some trouble in the build. It worked perfectly in the Unity editor, and after building the start & exit button stopped being clickable. If you understand what the issue is, I would very much appreciate comments on how to fix the issue.
I implemented a solution so that the executable is usable. Press "M" to start if the UI button does not work (this button is active the entire time, and was only used to get around the start menu bug). Press "X" to exit the game (this button is active the entire time, and was only used to get around the start menu bug).
